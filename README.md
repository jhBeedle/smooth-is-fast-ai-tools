# Smooth is Fast: AI Tools

**A collection of practical AI tools and frameworks from the [Smooth is Fast](https://smoothisfast.substack.com) newsletter.**

This repository houses AI tools, prompts, and frameworks that bridge culinary discipline with automation efficiency. Each tool emphasizes the "smooth is fast" philosophy: doing things correctly the first time is faster than rushing and redoing work.

## Philosophy

These tools translate professional kitchen principles—mise en place, brigade systems, and sequential workflows—into AI automation frameworks. They're designed to make AI more accessible while maintaining technical rigor.

## Available Tools

### [Cream Puff Framework](./cream-puff-framework/)
A system prompt framework for building AI assistants with layered structure and clear component separation. Just as a cream puff has distinct structural (shell, filling) and flavor (craquelin, toppings) layers, this framework organizes AI behavior into Core Structure (personality, restrictions) and Flavor Layers (domain knowledge, capabilities).

**Use cases:** Custom AI assistants, chatbots, specialized automation agents
